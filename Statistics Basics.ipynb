    "Ans  \n",
    " The measures of central tendency are statistical tools used to summarize a set of data by identifying a central point within the data.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Mean\n",
    "\n",
    "  Definition: The mean is the arithmetic average of a set of values, calculated by adding up all the values and then dividing by the number of values.\n",
    "\n",
    " Formula  Mean= N/∑X  \n",
    " ​where  ∑X is the sum of all data points, and  N is the number of data points.    \n",
    "\n",
    " When to use it: The mean is generally used when you have continuous data that is symmetrically distributed or nearly symmetric without significant outliers. It is most appropriate for normally distributed data because it takes all data points into account and provides a precise average.\n",
    "\n",
    " Example:  \n",
    "\n",
    " If you are analyzing the average score of students on a test, the mean is a good measure to use if the scores do not have extreme outliers.\n",
    " Data: 10, 20, 30, 40, 50\n",

    "* Median  \n",
    "\n",
    " Definition: The median is the middle value in a data set when the values are arranged in order. If the data set has an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.  \n",
    "\n",
    " When to use it: The median is a better measure when the data is skewed or contains outliers, as it is not affected by extreme values. It is often used with ordinal, interval, or ratio level data.  \n",
    "\n",
    " Example:  \n",
    " \n",
    "  If you are analyzing household income, and there is one billionaire in the data, the mean might be misleading, but the median would reflect the typical income better.  \n",

    "  If the data had an even number of values (e.g., 10, 20, 30, 40), the median would be the average of 20 and 30, so 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mode \n",
    "\n",
    " Definition: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a data set. There can be more than one mode (bimodal, multimodal), or there may be no mode if all values occur with the same frequency.  \n",

    "Example:  \n",

    "Ans  \n",
    "\n",
    "Dispersion refers to the extent to which data points in a data set differ from the central tendency (mean, median, or mode) and from each other. In simple terms, it measures the spread or variability of data. If the data points are spread out widely, the dispersion is high, and if the data points are clustered closely around the central value, the dispersion is low.  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Variance\n",
    "\n",
    " * Definition: Variance is a measure of how far each data point is from the mean of the data set, and it is calculated as the average of the squared differences from the mean. In other words, it tells you the \"average squared deviation\" from the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Standard Deviation  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Definition: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It provides a measure of spread in the same units as the original data, making it easier to interpret than variance. The standard deviation tells us how much individual data points typically differ from the mean.    \n",
    "\n",
    " When to Use Variance vs. Standard Deviation:  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Variance is often used in mathematical models and when working with theoretical distributions, but because it uses squared units, it can be less intuitive for practical interpretation.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Standard Deviation is more commonly used for understanding the spread of data in real-world contexts because it is expressed in the same units as the data itself, making it easier to interpret.  \n",

    "\n",
    "A box plot  is a graphical representation of the distribution of a data set that provides a summary of the data's central tendency, spread, and potential outliers. It displays key statistical measures in a compact form, making it a useful tool for comparing distributions across multiple groups or for understanding the shape of a data set.  \n",

    " * Central Tendency (Median):  \n",
    "\n",
    "The median provides a quick visual indication of the central point of the data. If the median is closer to the top or bottom of the box, it may suggest a skew in the distribution.  \n",
    "\n",
    " * Spread (Interquartile Range):  \n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR (distance between Q1 and Q3) shows how spread out the middle 50% of the data is. A larger IQR indicates greater variability, while a smaller IQR suggests less variability.\n",

    " * Symmetry and Skewness:\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of the median within the box can help identify if the data is skewed:\n",
    "If the median is near the center of the box, the data is relatively symmetric.\n",

    "Outliers are data points that are significantly higher or lower than the rest of the data. These are represented as dots or asterisks outside the whiskers.  \n",

It helps minimize bias, ensures generalizability, and supports valid statistical analysis.

    "Ans  \n",
    "Skewness refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data. In a perfectly symmetrical distribution, like the normal distribution, the left and right halves of the data are mirror images of each other, meaning the data is evenly distributed around the mean. Skewness quantifies how much a distribution deviates from this symmetry. It indicates whether the data tends to have more extreme values on one side (the left or right) of the mean.  \n",

    "\n",
    "Symmetrical distributions have no skew, with the mean equal to the median  \n",
    "\n",
    " * How Skewness Affects the Interpretation of Data \n",
    "\n",
    "In a positively skewed distribution, the mean is pulled to the right, so it is greater than the median. This can make the mean seem higher than what is typical for most of the data. The median may provide a better central measure of tendency in this case because it is less affected by outliers.  \n",

    "\n",
    "* Using the IQR to Detect Outliers  \n",
    "\n",
    "The IQR is often used to identify outliers in a data set. Outliers are values that fall significantly outside the typical range of the data, and the IQR provides a robust way of detecting them.  \n",
