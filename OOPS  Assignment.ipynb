    "1. What are the five key concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)  \n",
    "Ans  \n",
    " *  Inheritance  \n",
    "  This mechanism allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and methods from an existing class (superclass or base class). Inheritance promotes code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "*  Abstraction    \n",
    " Abstraction simplifies complex reality by modeling classes based on the essential characteristics while hiding unnecessary details. This allows programmers to focus on interactions at a higher level without needing to understand all underlying complexities.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Polymorphism  \n",
    " Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling a single function or method to operate on different types of objects. This can be achieved through method overriding (in subclasses) and method overloading (same method name with different parameters).  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Composition  \n",
    " While not always listed in the traditional four principles, composition involves building complex objects from simpler ones, enabling code reuse and flexibility. It promotes the \"has-a\" relationship as opposed to the \"is-a\" relationship established by inheritance.  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Encapsulation  \n",
    " This concept involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, or class. It restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which helps prevent unintended interference and misuse\n"
